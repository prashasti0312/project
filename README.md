IN THIS PROJECT WE ARE LEARNING GIT MANAGEMENT BY MANAGING A BIG CODE WITH THE HELP OF COLLABORATORS.

THERE ARE 3 COLLABORATORS IN THIS REPOSITORY - MUSKAAN , NEHA AND KHUSHBU.

The code is on restaurant billing system.
First of all, I pushed the code containing function for food and function for displaying food menu.

Then, Neha forked this repository and cloned it. Then she pushed function for food bill and function for deleting food menu into the master. Then, she sent me a pull request which I merged using Git merge command.

Then, Muskaan forked the repository and after cloning it she pushed function for information related to the customer and function for customer bill into the master. After receiving her pull request, I merged it.

At last, Khushbu forked the same repository and cloned it. She pushed function for billing system and function for customer feedback into the master.
